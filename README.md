<h1 align="center">My Travel BucketList</h1>

My first solo project, this website was built using Python and run with Flask, and HTML and CSS were used for front-end styling.

This app allows users to complete CRUD actions by tracking countries and cities they want to visit and those they have visited, including:
- adding new countries to their bucketlist
- adding new cities to each of these countries
- marking cities as ‘visited’ or ‘want to visit’
- editing and deleting added cities and countries from their bucketlist
- adding photos or images to cities

The project was completed over one week and concluded with a public presentation. As a keen traveller, I was excited to explore the possibility of creating a website or app that I myself would use. 

This project makes use of Object-Oriented Programming with Python, Test Driven Development, Web Programming (REST, MVC), and interacts with a PostgreSQL database with CRUD principles, and SQLAlchemy.
